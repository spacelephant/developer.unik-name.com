                <h4>A single identifier for all the cyberspace: web platforms, mobile apps, corporate systems.</h4>
                  <p>Use the same ID, your personnal @unik-name, to get connected to multiple systems. It's like with your email address but without having to create a new password and without taking risk with your email account.</p>

                  <li><a href="examples.html#example6">Corporate Cloud Integration (exemple #6)</a></li>
                </ol>
            
                <h4>Respectfull of your privacy</h4>
                  <p>Every time you create an account to a system, you must provide a unique ID to the system, and a user name. 
                    It's common on web platforms to use your email address for both. In this case it's obvious that your email is exposed to hacks, even on the hardly secured systems.
                    Another solution is to use the social authentication buttons. Everyone know now that by doing so you provide a tracker to the social platform and the're able to track all you activity on the net.</p>
                    <p>@unik-name Connect generates a different ID for every sign-up and it provides a different proxy email when one is required. There's no possible link between every website. Furthermore your email address stays private.</p>
                    <p>The only one who knows where you've been connected is you and only you. Open your @unik-name wallet mobile app, choose "connection list" in the menu to see it. For every link you can see which data you've shared and you can revoke access.</p>
